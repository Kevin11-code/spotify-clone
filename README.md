# Spotify Clone
#### Next.js, Tailwind CSS,SpotifyAPI, NextAuth and Recoil

## About the Project

* This project is a Spotify clone built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, NextAuth, and Recoil. The purpose of this project was to provide a hands-on learning experience for me while building a functional web application that emulates the features and design of the popular music streaming service, Spotify.

* The Spotify clone project is designed to provide a similar user experience to the original application. It features a home page with a search bar, navigation bar, and a list of popular tracks and playlists. Users can sign up and log in using NextAuth.js authentication and view their recently played tracks, favorite songs, and create their own playlists.

* The project also includes features like track playback, song search, and playlist creation, which are powered by the Spotify API. Recoil, a state management library, was used to manage the application's global state and provide smooth user interactions.

* Overall, this project serves as a great example of how to build a functional web application that mimics the features of a popular web service. The developer gained valuable experience in using popular front-end frameworks and libraries like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, NextAuth, and Recoil.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
